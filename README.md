# TaskManagerApp
This project contains two implementations of the task management app
A simple command-line task management application written in C and graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to:

➕ Add tasks with title, description, and priority (High, Medium, Low)

📄 Display all or only pending tasks

✅ Mark tasks as completed

🗑️ Delete tasks by title

🔀 Sort tasks by priority

💾 Save and load tasks from a local file (tasks.txt)

📤 Export tasks to a CSV file (tasks.csv) for easy sharing
